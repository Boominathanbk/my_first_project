    <h3 class="text-center text-danger">Tourism in Kerala</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="text-light">Kerala, a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of southwestern India, is one of the most popular
            tourist destinations in the country. Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic
            Traveler,[1] Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful backwaters.[2] Its
            unique culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demography, have made Kerala one of the most popular
            tourist destinations in the world. Several international agencies ranging from UNESCO to National Geographic
            have recognised the state's tourism potential.[3] Kerala was named by TIME magazine in 2022 among the 50
            extraordinary destinations to explore in its list of the World's Greatest Places.[4] In 2023, Kerala was
            listed at the 13th spot in The New York Times' annual list of places to visit and was the only tourist
            destination listed from India.[5] <br><p></p><p class="text-light">

            Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination, with most tourism circuits concentrated
            around the north of the country. Aggressive marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development
            Corporation—the government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the state—laid the foundation for the
            growth of the tourism industry. In the decades that followed, Kerala Tourism was able to transform itself
            into one of the niche holiday destinations in India. The tag line Kerala – God's Own Country was adopted in
            its tourism promotions and became a global superbrand. Kerala is regarded as one of the destinations with
            the highest brand recall.[6] In 2010, Kerala attracted 660,000 foreign tourist arrivals.[7]

            Kerala is a popular destination for both domestic as well as foreign tourists. Kerala is well known for its
            beaches, backwaters in Alappuzha and Kollam, mountain ranges and wildlife sanctuaries. Other popular
            attractions in the state include the beaches at Kovalam, Muzhappilangad, Bekal and Kappad; backwater tourism
            and lake resorts around Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam; hill stations and resorts at Munnar, Wayanad, Nelliampathi,
            Vagamon and Ponmudi; and national parks and wildlife sanctuaries at Wayanad, Periyar, Parambikulam, Silent
            Valley National Park and Eravikulam National Park. The "backwaters" region—an extensive network of
            interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that centre on Vembanad Lake, also see heavy tourist traffic.
            Heritage sites, such as the Padmanabhapuram Palace, Hill Palace, and Mattancherry Palace, are also visited.
            To further promote tourism in Kerala, the Grand Kerala Shopping Festival was started by the Government of
            Kerala in 2007.[8] Since then it has been held every year during the December–January period.

            The state's tourism agenda promotes ecologically sustained tourism, which focuses on the local culture,
            wilderness adventures, volunteering and personal growth of the local population. Efforts are taken to
            minimize the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural environment and enhance the cultural
            integrity of local people. The state has also made deep inroads into MICE Tourism mainly centered at
            Kochi.[9]</p>
